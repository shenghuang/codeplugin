The code plugin software is a Chrome extension to help users search and use GoC Open Data, thus contribute to solving problems and 
increasing productivity through the use of Open Data.

It has the following major features:
1. An option page allows users to input keywords for searching datasets. Returned datasets are displayed in the format of links to 
the owner org's website if the url is provided in the dataset, or else links to the data.gc.ca site are displayed. 
2. Search term and results are saved in HTML5 local storage so that they persist during browser restarts. Counter of unvisited links 
are displayed on the extension icon shown to the right of the Chrome toolbar.
3. A Javascript listener monitors links clicked by the user and update the plugin counter at the background. 
4. Users can easily share interested datasets on their social media websites including Twitter and Facebook.
5. Multilingual support. All extension pages support both two official languages - English or French depending on the current user 
browser locale. 
6. HTML5 messaging API is used to dynamic update and synchronise contents across different pages without introducing the confusion of 
page refreshes.
7. If Geocoding information (spatial element in the CKAN datasets) is provided, a custom Google Map is provided to show the distance 
between user's current location and the event location in the interested datasets. For example, if a user search "Severe Thunderstorms"
from the datasets of Natural Resource Canada. 

More features like storing the search results in browser bookmarks, and notifying users when interested datasets have been updated on the 
server can be easily added to the plugin.

As Chrome has around 40% market share of desktop and mobile browsers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers), this 
browser extension will be able to reach a large user community and help them to use and manage datasets in which they are interested. 
As all major browsers including IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari support extensions (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension), the same approach can be applied to other browsers.
